This repository contains my solutions to the programming exercises of 
[ROSALIND](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) project. 

The code contains a simple client that take an input file data and 
a module name.

The solutions to each problem could be found in the `lib/`
module, and each of them have a function main that will be called 
by the client.
